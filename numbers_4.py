# NUMBERS AND OPERATORS
# (e) or (E) act as a power for any no. eg.(10^10)
# we can covert any data type of numerical into another
# when we convert any float into int it uses greatest integer function [float]

x = 10e10
y = 5E10
z = 10.7
print(x)
print(type(x))
print(y)
print(type(y))
print(z)
print(type(z))

a = int(x)
z = int(z)
print(a)
print(z)
a = 50
b = 7
# it prints question
print(a//b)
# it prints the whole value including decimals
print(a/b)
# it prints remainder
print(a % b)
# power of a to b
print(a**b)
